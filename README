This is a bare bones rails app that demonstrates how to deploy using bundler and capistrano to EC2. It can be easily modifed to deploy to just about any environment.

To get it running, assign values to the following configuration options in deploy.rb 
- application
- repository
- scm
- deploy_to
- server
- ssh_options

This app assumes your are authenticating over ssh using an identity file.

Also ensure the user you ssh as is the owner of the directory you are deploying to.

Once those are set, you can run

cap deploy:setup
cap deploy:migrate
cap deploy
